# html2rss-configs

This repository contains [html2rss](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss) configs for several websites. Find all provided configs in the [`configs/` directory](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/tree/master/lib/html2rss/configs).

A handy method to use these configs is via [html2rss-web](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-web).

## Usage via html2rss-web

If you're running [html2rss-web](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-web),
you have nothing more to do! ðŸŽ‰

Your full request URL might looks like this:
`http://my.server/html2rss/github.com/nuxt.js_releases.rss`

## Usage without html2rss-web

Add this line to your Gemfile:

`gem 'html2rss-configs', git: 'https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs.git'`

Use it in your code:

```
require 'html2rss/configs'

Html2rss::Configs.find_by_name('domainname.tld/whatever')
```

This will return the feed config as a Hash with String keys.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome!

### Adding a new config

There's a generator for that! ðŸ†’

1. `make config domain=domainname.tld name=whatever`  
    (Change `domain` and `name` values to desired values.)
2. Head to the generated files and add the selectors etc.
    Look around in the existing config.yml files for examples, e.g. the extensive [github.com/nuxt.js_releases.yml](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/blob/master/lib/html2rss/configs/github.com/nuxt.js_releases.yml).

3. To see the generated feed, run:  
    `bin/fetch domainname.tld/whatever`

### Gotchas and tips & tricks

- Check that the channel URL does not redirect to a mobile page with a different markup structure.
- Do not rely on your web browser's developer console. html2rss does not execute JavaScript.
- Fiddling with [`curl`](https://github.com/curl/curl) and [`pup`](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) to find the selectors seems efficient.

## Building on the CI

Modifying existing or adding new configs will trigger the CI to fetch the feed
and check for the presence of feed items.

See [.travis.yml -> script](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/blob/master/.travis.yml) which commands execute during build.
