# html2rss-configs

This repository contains [html2rss](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss) configs for many websites. Find all provided configs in the [`configs/` directory](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/tree/master/lib/html2rss/configs).

A handy method to use these configs is via [html2rss-web](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-web).

## Usage via html2rss-web

If you're running [html2rss-web](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-web),
you have nothing more to do! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage without html2rss-web

Add to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'html2rss-configs', git: 'https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs.git'
```

Use it in your code:

```ruby
require 'html2rss/configs'

config = Html2rss::Configs.find_by_name('domainname.tld/whatever')
```

This will return the feed config as a Hash with String keys.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome!

### Adding a new config

There's a generator for that! ðŸ†’

1. `make config domain=domainname.tld name=whatever`  
    Change `domain` and `name` values to desired values.
2. Head to the generated files and add the selectors and options.  
    Look around in the existing config.yml files for examples, e.g. the extensive [github.com/releases.yml](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/blob/master/lib/html2rss/configs/github.com/releases.yml).

3. To see the generated feed, run:  
    `bin/fetch domainname.tld/whatever`
    And with dynamic parameters:
    `bin/fetch domainname.tld/whatever id=42 foo="bar baz"`

### Gotchas and tips & tricks

- Check that the channel URL does not redirect to a mobile page with a different markup structure.
- Do not rely on your web browser's developer console. html2rss does not execute JavaScript.
- Fiddling with [`curl`](https://github.com/curl/curl) and [`pup`](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) to find the selectors seems efficient.

### Dynamic parameters in `channel` attributes

Sometimes there are structurally equal pages with different URLs. In such a case you can add _variables_ to the channel's `url`, `title` and `language` attributes.

In your config YAML:

```yaml
channel:
  title: 'domainname.tld: whatever %<id>s'
  url: 'http://domainname.tld/whatever/%<id>s.html'
```

See the _more complex formatting_ of the [`sprintf` method](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Kernel.html#method-i-sprintf) for more complex formatting options.

You have to provide the parameters to the shared rspec example, too:

```ruby
include_examples 'config.yml', 'domainname.tld/whatever.yml', id: 42
```

Programmatic usage:

```ruby
config = Html2rss::Configs.find_by_name('domainname.tld/whatever', { id: 42 })
```

## Building on the CI

Modifying existing or adding new configs will trigger the CI to fetch the feed
and check for the presence of feed items.

See [.travis.yml -> script](https://github.com/gildesmarais/html2rss-configs/blob/master/.travis.yml) which commands execute during build.
